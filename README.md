# Wixzel OS

**Wixzel OS** - One of my best Visual Basic projects, created during the summer vacation when I was in 9th grade. It was an exciting and challenging project that I worked on with great passion.

Unfortunately, my hard disk was wiped due to issues with my PC, and I didn’t have any backup of the project files. At that time, I wasn’t familiar with GitHub, so everything was stored locally and lost during the incident. 

Thankfully, I managed to recover the `setup.exe` file from one of my sent emails. Additionally, for some reason, I had shared screenshots of the project via email, and I was able to retrieve those as well. Here are the recovered screenshots showcasing parts of the project:
